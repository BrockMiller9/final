# Information 
This is a web application that gives the users the abillity to search for books through different means. Users are able to create a reading list that they are able to keep track of favorited books they want to read. Users are also able to search for any book, find random books, and receive book recommendations. Book lists are only accessible through user login/sign up. I am using python for the backend, javascript for the front end, and postgreSQL for the database. I also use frameworks/tools such as flask, WTForms, axios, and jinja.
